# AGENT_SYNC.md — Massoh

**The shared dashboard for all agents — current state, latest handoff, decisions.**
Read at every session boot; update after every meaningful task (`/sync`). Dashboard, not a history
dump — task detail lives in `.agent_tasks/`, decisions of record in `docs/adr/`.

Last updated: 2026-06-16 ( repo opted in; agent-project filled; backlog seeded )

## Current strategic mode
v0.1 post-extraction — validate that a portable, gated agent OS reduces build-trap for solo+Claude
shipping. Activation = a repo opts in and lands one packet `00→06` to merge. (see PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md)

## Current task
None in flight. **Shipped v0.2.0** — both PRs merged to main (`814df69`) + deployed (`massoh install`,
`doctor` healthy). Next candidate: backlog #1 (enforce license-gate mechanically).
