# AGENT_SYNC.md — Massoh

**The shared dashboard for all agents — current state, latest handoff, decisions.**
Read at every session boot; update after every meaningful task (`/sync`). Dashboard, not a history
dump — task detail lives in `.agent_tasks/`, decisions of record in `docs/adr/`.

Last updated: 2026-06-17 ( TASK-2026-06-17-efficiency-v2 — FINAL APPROVE: T14g real test confirmed; 137/137 green; all A/B/C conditions verified; ready for owner commit + PR )

## Current strategic mode
v0.1 post-extraction — validate that a portable, gated agent OS reduces build-trap for solo+Claude
shipping. Activation = a repo opts in and lands one packet `00→06` to merge. (see PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md)

## Current task
**TASK-2026-06-17-efficiency-v2** — FINAL APPROVE issued by reviewer-qa. T14g fix confirmed real (find-based dir snapshot, single-quote anti-pattern gone). All A1-A5/B1-B5/C1-C6 conditions independently verified. 137/137 green. Ready for owner commit + PR.

**Previous task:** TASK-2026-06-17-massoh-learn — APPROVED by reviewer-qa. All 4 conditions independently verified; 105/105 green. Ready for owner to merge (commit + open PR).

| 2026-06-17 | TASK-2026-06-17-efficiency-v2: arch/safety **APPROVED all 3 slices** — A: 5 conditions (--every parsing safe, dry-run suppression, default-30 fallback, counter logic frozen, cmd_install crontab update); B: 5 conditions (git log %ct for dates — stat banned, || true on all greps, div-zero guard, append-only in snapshot block, --no-write checksum test); C: 6 conditions (write_recommend=0 default, >> append + awk || true, || true on all reads, <2-snapshot degrade, sole write target AGENT_SYNC.md, no cron auto-add); tests T12/T13/T14 specified | architecture-safety |
