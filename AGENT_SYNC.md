# AGENT_SYNC.md — Massoh

**The shared dashboard for all agents — current state, latest handoff, decisions.**
Read at every session boot; update after every meaningful task (`/sync`). Dashboard, not a history
dump — task detail lives in `.agent_tasks/`, decisions of record in `docs/adr/`.

Last updated: 2026-06-17 ( TASK-2026-06-17-cadence-cron rev2 — APPROVED by reviewer-qa, 79/79 green )

## Current strategic mode
v0.1 post-extraction — validate that a portable, gated agent OS reduces build-trap for solo+Claude
shipping. Activation = a repo opts in and lands one packet `00→06` to merge. (see PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md)

## Current task
**TASK-2026-06-17-cadence-cron** — APPROVED by reviewer-qa (rev2 final review). All 4 conditions
satisfied; 79/79 green. Ready for owner to merge (commit + open PR).
